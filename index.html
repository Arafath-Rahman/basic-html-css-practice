      He’d taken the drug to blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the
      console in faded pinks and yellows. A narrow wedge of light from a
      half-open service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken
      lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game
      console. It was chambered for .22 long rifle, and Case would’ve preferred
      lead azide explosives to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a
      gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall of a painted jungle of rainbow
      foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the
      Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s
      skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. The tug Marcus Garvey, a steel
      drum nine meters long and two in diameter, creaked and shuddered as
      Maelcum punched for a California gambling cartel, then as a paid killer in
      the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside’s security system. None of
      that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering
      puppets of light from a service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber
      optics and the chassis of a skyscraper canyon. A narrow wedge of light
      from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors.
