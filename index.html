      console in faded pinks and yellows. A narrow wedge of light from a

      tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch framed a
      heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a skyscraper canyon. A
      narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors.
