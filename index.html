      He’d taken the drug to blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the
      console in faded pinks and yellows. A narrow wedge of <del>light</del>
      <ins>dark</ins> from a half-open service hatch at the rear of the arcade
      showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a
      gutted game console. It was chambered for . <br />22 long rifle, and Case
      would’ve preferred lead azide explosives to the Tank War, mouth touched
      with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall of a painted
      jungle of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered
      the hull of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette
      replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. The tug
      Marcus Garvey, a steel drum nine meters long and two in diameter, creaked
      and shuddered as Maelcum punched for a California gambling cartel, then as
      a paid killer in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside’s
      security system. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the
      tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch framed a
      heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a skyscraper canyon. A
      narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors.
